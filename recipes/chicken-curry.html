        <h3>Mum's style homemade chicken curry</h3>
        <p>Nepali chicken tarkari is often served as part of a thali.<br>
             This is where multiple dishes surround the rice and dal called dal bhat, that is considered the national dish.<br>
             Tarkari can be made vegetarian with simply vegetables but we loved this version made with chicken.</p>
